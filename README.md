# Bioengineering Calculations

This public repository will store all of the implentations of the various calculations and formula used in the course of my studies with NTU's Bioengineering programme.

Feel free to use it as reference while writing your own programs, particularly for BG2211, or for any labs.

## Important Note

The programme recommends MATLAB as the language of choice for doing any mathematical calculations. However, I am stubborn and don't want to contend with MATLAB until I have to.

This repo will mostly be written in JavaScript (TypeScript) or C#, maybe even Golang as these are the languages I am most familiar with. Translating it to MATLAB will require some thought on your end.

Good luck with your studies!
